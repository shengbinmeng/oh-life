Today we walked the city Lhasa for a tour. We went to Jokhang Temple, Ramoche Temple, the Potala Palace, and Tibet University.

It was Saturday. My friend joined us for the trip to Nyingchi, which is famous for the beautiful scene and known as the "Little Swiss" of China.

In the morning, we went to the Yarlung Zangbo Grand Canyon. In the afternoon, we started off back to Lhasa. It took us about 9 hours on the way.

Today we went to the Nam Lake, the biggest in Tibet. The water and sky was stunning!

2014-08-05

On a tight schedule, I had to end the Tibet journey today. The train was leaving at 1 pm, so I visited the Tibet Museum in the morning. Never waste time, right?

2014-08-06

On the train back to Beijing. It's a long trip, and I slept in the restaurant car at night.

Beijing. I had some rest after the long trip, then prepared for my next travel. In the afternoon, I met my girlfriend hastily, and went to Beijing West Station. I will go to Jinggangshan with a training group.

Jinggangshan. After a night's train trip, we arrived at this famous place. A cicerone welcomes us.

2014-08-09

As part of the training, we went to the Martyrs Cemetery and the Revolution Museum. Then we had a interview with the later generations of some Revolution heroes.

Last day of the training program. We had a Laser Tag (or CS live). It was exciting. Then we went to take the train back to Beijing.

The vacation is over and I began to work today. I transferred one of my iOS apps to another guy. He will continue the development.

The Beijing SanGuoSha Club I maintained in meetup.com has asked me to pay for the organizer dues. It’s a little expensive, so I requested donation from the members. Good luck to me!

2014-08-13

I released the library and header files of HEVC decoder for Ubuntu.

2014-08-14

A professor of Beijing Jiaotong University asked me if I will go to attend MMSP 2014, and wanted someone to help him present his paper. I told him though my paper was accepted, I will not be able to attend the conference. My boss will go on behalf of me.

2014-08-15

My instructor wanted me to help him find some previous test papers of the admission exam held by School of Foreign Language of Peking University (he was doing a favour for others, as a matter of fact). I asked the people at the school, and was told that they never provided that. So I can only search the Internet and see what I will get.

Had dinner with my girlfriend’s friend at XiabuXiabu. The guy was late for one hour and ordered too much.

2014-08-17

This Sunday we had rest in my room and my girlfriend did some laundry for me. Thank you my sweetheart!

The online commerce merchant Suning today provided a big discount for the Oreo cookie: 2 RMB for a box (about 30% of the original price).
I bought 35 boxes.

The result of VCIP reviews came out. It seems my two demo papers were not quite recognised by the reviewers. Anyway, I prepared the rebuttal and hoped for the best.

2014-08-20

Considering that my papers submitted to VCIP may be rejected, I started to prepare submission for the MMM conference which comes next. The original two demo papers will be merged into one, so that it’s more likely to be accepted.

2014-08-21

I helped the engineers of Intel to prepare for a demonstration they will make.

2014-08-22

I tried an online education system. It provides online classroom and various ways for the teacher and students to communicate with each other in real time, including video/audio conference, text chat and shared screen/files.

The system is called Wanxiaotong ( http://www.wangxiaotong.com/ ).

2014-08-23

I updated my Ubuntu OS to version 14.04. And for some reason, I modified my Yahoo account. Yahoo gave me very bad experience, making me think that it’s really an outdated company. Sorry for this old-time Internet giant.

2014-08-24

On this weekend, I went to the Macworld 2014 exhibition with my girlfriend. A lab mate joined us at CNCC, the place holding this event.
It’s a very cheerful experience.

2014-08-25

I played a game from 10pm last evening until 7am this morning. Well, it’s OK to stay up all night from time to time.
Just don’t do that frequently.

2014-08-26

I went to the company Realpower265 and met some people from Taiwan and India to talk about HEVC encoder business.
I was supposed to be the translator between the India and my advisor. However, the Taiwan guy was doing that all time instead of me.

2014-08-27

I registered Baifubao (Baidu Wallet) to get big discounts from Baidu's promotion programs. However, I think Baifubao will never replace Alipay as Chinese people's primary online payment method.

2014-08-28

To fight GFW, I tried another tool: http://blog.honx.in/ .

2014-08-29

Submitted a demo paper to MMM 2015 ( http://www.mmm2015.org/ ).

2014-08-30

Ordered an iPad Air for my girlfriend. It costs 3078 RMB.

2014-08-31

I registered IMDB today in order to give high score for the movie "Primary Target".

Had a phone meeting with Intel's people.
Registered ICC 2014. When paying the registration fee (720$), there was no enough dollars in the account of my credit card. So I called the bank to increase my credit limit.

It’s Valentine’s Day, and it’s also the Lantern Festival in China. Cuicui and me invited two of my friends to cook YuanXiao (sweet dumplings made of glutinous rice flour) in my dormitory.
I made a gift and gave it to my girl today. It’s here: http://blog.shengbin.me/posts/cuicui-and-me-for-the-valentine-day .

Today I paid 702€ for ICASSP 2014 registration. But I didn't find how to obtain the invoice of that payment.
So I sent an email to ask them. Still waiting for the reply.

Today I met an English guy in Beijing SanGuoSha Club. We talked in WeChat (Weixin).
Both English and Chinese were used and the conversation was a pleasure.

2014-02-22

We went skiing at night. My girlfriend also came with us. She never skied before, so it took me sometime to teach her.

It was fun anyway.

2014-02-23

We had the SanGuoSha meetup today. It was really fun!
The English guy is very friendly, and we all had a good time playing and talking with him.

I accepted a job of teaching a boy computer science. His goal is to pass the AP(Advance Placement) exam.

In the evening, I watched the movie “The Hobbit 2” with my friend. The movie is about three hours long.
Wearing the 3D glasses for such a long time is really a pain! The movie itself is fine.

Today we went to Intel’s office to have a meeting with some of its employees.

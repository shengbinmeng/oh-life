My girlfriend attempted to buy a dress but canceled it at last. However, the seller still expressed it to me.
I did not conform with my girl and credited the money as required. So now I had to ask for a refund.
What a tragedy!

This Sunday is a new start. In the morning, I taught AP class (computer science, mainly Java programming)and earned 400 RMB.
In the afternoon, I went to the library of my girl's university and read some books. Then I had dinner with my roommates. There was first AP class then SanGuoSha in the evening.

2014-03-03

I contacted the merchant who has mailed me the deliveries even though my girl canceled the order.

I asked for a refund and they refused.

2014-03-04

In the evening I watched the movie "12 Years a Slave", which has won the 2014 Oscar's Best Picture Award.

2014-03-11

Fetched the approval for my going abroad. And begin to prepare for the visa application.

2014-03-12

Prepared the required materials for my visa application. Would go to Italy Visa Center tomorrow.

2014-03-13

Today I went to the Italy Visa Center to apply my visa. The girl checked my application materials and pointed out some required docs were missing.
So she suggested I go back to do enough preparation and come again.
I was in a low mood for the rest of the day.

2014-03-14

Today I told my parents to help preparing the required documents for my visa, mainly the relationship certificate notarised and legalised by the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

2014-03-15

I told my Dad how to prepare and mail me the documents that are needed by my visa application.
My girlfriend wanted to travel with me, so she called her parents to help apply the visa too.

2014-03-16

It was planned to have a SanGuoSha meetup today. However, some of those who RSVPed "yes" failed to come. So I spent the afternoon playing a RPG game.It's a game about sword.

2014-03-17

I learned some information about how to get a relationship certificate notarised and legalised by the Chinese
Ministry of Foreign Affairs, for my visa application. First, my university should give a letter of certification about my relationship with my parents;
then I ask a notary office to make a notarised certificate (with the Italian translation) for me; finally I go to Beijing Foreign Affairs Office to legalise it.

So let’s do it.

2014-03-18

Today I went to the notary office. I paid them to notarize and translate for me. The notarized certificate will be ready three days later (hope so).

2014-03-19

I learned that my submitted paper was rejected.
So I would be in a very bad mood during tonight's date and movie watching. Oh God!

2014-03-20

Still in a bad mood because my paper was rejected.

2014-03-21

The notification email was sent to tell me my paper decision. So it's confirmed bad news.

2014-03-22

I uploaded the requested Response Form and W8 Tax Form for my travel grant.
The documents need to be signed by me. So I learned about digital signature.

2014-03-23

I was told the tax form I uploaded yesterday must be signed by hand rather that digitally. So I printed, hand-signed, scanned and re-uploaded the document.

2014-03-24

I found an error in my camera-ready version of my ICASSP 2014 paper. So I corrected the error and uploaded again.

2014-03-25

The program of ICC 2014 (http://icc2014.ieee-icc.org/program.html ) came out. I need to give an oral presentation for my paper. I asked my adviser whether I can go to attend the conference if I can successfully apply for the travel grant. He said yes.

2014-03-26

Today I went to Italy Visa Center to submit materials. They accepted it. An interview is also needed for first-time applicant like me. I have appointed the interview to be at 11:00 tomorrow morning.

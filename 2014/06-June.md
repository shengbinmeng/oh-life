It’s Children’s Day, also during the holiday of Dragon Boat Festival. After lunch, I asked my girl, “What about going to Tianjin?” She said yes, and we left for the railway station, nothing prepared.

We took a tour in Tianjin the whole day, from The Five Avenues to the city’s two top universities, then to Eye of Tianjin, the Ferris wheel on a bridge.
In the evening, we returned to Beijing form Tianjin. No early tickets could be bought, so I arrived at dormitory very late, at about 11:30 pm.

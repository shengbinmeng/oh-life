The room my GF rent doesn’t have an air conditioner so I want to get one. I looked at the SecondHand board on the university’s BBS and saw a message saying a guy was selling. However, I contacted him only to find that the machine had already been sold out. OK forget it then.

Intel’s people complained that a TS file could not be played by my HEVPlayer. They also sent a tablet for test. I found that HEVPlayer was already installed on that device. I tried the file they mentioned and guess what? It played very well!
Lately the guy in Intel explained that he used a device not supporting 4K OpenGL rendering, and the TS file was a 4K video.

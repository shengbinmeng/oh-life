Arrived in Rome, Italy by air. The flight was good.

I met a girl on the plane, and we'd like to have lunch together tomorrow.

2014-05-02

In the morning, I wen to the "wish spring" of Rome with the girl I met. And in the afternoon, the Colosseum.

It rained in the afternoon, so I returned to my hostel early.

2014-05-03

Today I went to Vatican, Spanish square and other famous places in Rome. At about 5pm, I took a train to Florence.

2014-05-04

I joined another guy. We went to the conference venue, only to find that the registration would begin in the afternoon. So we decided to go to The Mall for shopping.

2014-05-05

The conference would be giving tutorials the whole day. Since I did not buy the tutorial tickets, I took a tour in Florence.
In the evening, it was the welcome reception.

2014-05-06

Attending the conference sessions all day, and the concert in the evening.

The last day and night at Florence. Went to the conference sessions in the morning, and transferred to another hotel in the afternoon.

Near noon, I left for the airport. The bus did not stop at the airport so I missed it. When I came back by hitchhiking, it was too late. Lucky enough, they arranged a later flight for me, so I arrived at Frankfurt in time. Then I would take a China Air flight to Beijing.

2014-05-11

I landed in Beijing at about 1:00 pm. My girlfriend picked up me at the airport and we spent the rest of the day (plus the night) together. Glad back!

Back from ICASSP, I uploaded the conference proceeding to our group’s FTP server, shared with the group candies I brought from Italy, and prepared for a report about my attending.

2014-05-13

A bad news came that my application for the ICC 2014 Travel Grant had not been accepted. It’s terrible because I will not be able to go to Sydney to attend the conference. Damn it!

One of the development tablets Intel gave me failed to charge. I asked their engineer and was told the battery was completely exhausted, so with no power at all, the charging circuit won’t even work. A product will reserve some power when it’s shutdown for low battery, but the development tablets don’t have this function. So, I had to send the device back to Intel for them to fix. 

2014-05-15

As the device manager of our group, I helped Mrs. Han, the device manager of our institute, to verify the device information today.

Besides, I gave a report about attending the ICASSP 2014 in our group (http://prezi.com/h8wl_zvhtp1m/icassp-2014-report/ ).

2014-05-16

I have been waiting for my flight ticket (needed for thereimbursement) all week. The ticket agency did not send it to me until now, Friday.
Their service is really terrible, which I will never use again.

2014-05-17

Today I went to the memorial hall of China’s tunnel warfare site at Jiaozhuanghu, suburbs of Beijing. 

2014-05-18

This Sunday I had a good rest in house and watched the TV series 24.

2014-05-19

As the branch secretary of the Communist Party branch, I called for a meeting to discuss the admission of a student’s joining the Party.

2014-05-20

My paper“A PID-based Quality Control Algorithm for SVC Video Streaming” is arranged to be presented at the following time slot:

CSSMA-01:Video Services and QoE/QoS Management Ifrom Wed, June 11, 2014 11:00 until 12:30 (4th paper) in Lvl 1/Rm 7 (18.0 min.)

However, the presenter of this paper also needs to present a paper at theCISS-P1 session, which is at 11:45-12:30 of the same day.

So today I contacted the session chair for a solution.

2014-05-21

I applied for reimbursement of the fees attending the ICASSP 2014.

2014-05-22

After several rounds of emails, I finally solved the problem of changing the presentation order of my paper at the ICC 2014 session. An author from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications agreed to swap with me.
Besides, today I finished the submission of my two demo papers.

2014-05-23

I saw an accident today. The glass door of our institute building crashed into pieces, all of a sudden!
I helped to take a picture of the scene and sent to the staff.

At ICASSP 2014, I attended the activity hold by Google Research (and got a T-shirt from them:). Today they sent a email offering several ways to keep in touch. Nice!

2014-05-29

I was notified that someone is following me on Quora(http://www.quora.com). In fact I did nothing there.
The Chinese version of that asking society is call Zhihu(http://www.zhihu.com), where I answer some questions from time to time.

In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.

2014-01-02

The earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep.

2014-01-03

The Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.

2014-01-04

God said, Let there be light; and there was light.

2014-01-05

God saw the light, that it was good; and God divided the light from the darkness.

2014-01-06

God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night.

2014-01-07

And the evening and the morning were the first day.

I am struggling with the problem of outputting audio on Android. The PCM given by FFmpeg is in float format, and needs conversion before writing to Android audio track.

An usual day.

The dinner we roommates had planned is cancelled because one of us got sick. What a pity! So I decide to eat dumplings for supper.
Last night I bought a dress for my girl. She looks beautiful in it.

A perfect day, isn't it?

﻿I asked Intel for some x86+Android devices, which are used to develope and test apps for them.They said they would send an ASUS tablet and a BayTrail FFRD tablet.
Looking forward to those toys.

2014-01-16

I received the tablets from Intel. The development of three apps is in process. Another two folks are working on them, too. Hope we can end all of this as soon as possible.

2014-01-17

Before noon, a phone conference with Intel; after noon, cooperation with others on Android development.
At about 3pm, I walked to the library and borrowed a book for a friend of mine. Had supper with a lab guy.
A boring day, and no girl with me tonight(my girl will spend the evening at their company’s annual party).

2014-01-18

﻿I called home and told my family the good news that one of my papers had been accepted. They were happy about this.

One more thing, I am planing to watch the movie "Despicable Me"

2014-01-19

﻿Today is a movie day! I watched "Despicable Me"(1&2) on my computer, and then watched "Olympus Has Fallen" at the university's Hall. It would be a perfect day if the following tragedy did not happened.

At about 11:00 pm, my girlfriend logged into my Medium account and deleted it! She tried to log out, but she ended up deleting. Oh dear, all the data was lost! I got really mad about this. Hope the Medium team can help me restore my account.

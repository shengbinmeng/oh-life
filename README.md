# Oh, Life

This book is the collection of Shengbin's diary.

Shengbin, with the family name Meng, is an IT man living in China. His life is nothing out of common. However, it's cool.

Shengbin began writting a diary from Jaunary 2014, when he came accross the website OhLife: <https://ohlife.com>. This site provides a service which allows the user to write something about the day by simply replying an email. This is a lovely service, and Shengbin began to write about his life then. The diary continued  for 9 months until OhLife was shutdown in October 2014.

Life is miserably short. It deserves a record. Other than benefit for the person himself, let's hope others will aslo get something by reading this.

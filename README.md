# Oh, Life

This book is the collection of Shengbin's diary.

Shengbin, with the family name Meng, is an IT man living in China. His life is nothing out of common. However, it's cool.

Shengbin began writting a diary from Jaunary 2014, when he came accross the website: <https://ohlife.com>. This site provides a service which allows the user to write something about the day by simply replying an email. This is a lovely service, and Shengbin began to write about his life then.

Life is miserably short. So it deserves a record. Other than benefit for the person himself, let's hope others will aslo get something by reading this.

Shengbin feels more comfortable to delay the life exposure a few months. Meaning, the diary of several months ago goes public now, and the diary now will be public several months later.

So this book will update as time goes by. Stay tuned!
